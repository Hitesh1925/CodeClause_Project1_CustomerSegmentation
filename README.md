# CodeClause_Project1_CustomerSegmentation
# Customer Segmentation using K-Means  
**CodeClause Internship – Project 1**  
**Intern:** Hitesh Suthar  
**Domain:** Data Science  
**Duration:** 01 Dec 2025 – 31 Dec 2025

## 📌 Project Description  
This project focuses on segmenting mall customers into different groups based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm.

Customer Segmentation helps businesses understand:  
- High-value customers  
- Low-spending customers  
- Target customers for marketing  
- Customer behavior patterns  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To apply **K-Means Clustering** and identify distinct customer groups for business insights.

---

## 🧠 What I Did  
- Loaded and analyzed the Mall Customers dataset  
- Performed EDA (info, summary, missing values check)  
- Selected best clustering features  
  - Annual Income (k$)  
  - Spending Score (1-100)  
- Identified optimal value of K using **Elbow Method**  
- Trained K-Means model with K=5  
- Visualized clusters with scatter plot  
- Generated final dataset with cluster labels  

---

## 📊 Visual Outputs  
- Elbow Curve  
- Cluster plot with centroids  
- Cluster-wise distribution  
- Cluster Profile Table  

(Plots are available inside the notebook)

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- K-Means Clustering  

---

## 📁 Files Included  
- `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` → Full code + plots  
- `mall_customers_with_clusters.csv` → Final dataset with cluster labels  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

---

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Download the repo  
2. Open `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
3. Install required libraries (if needed):  
4. Run all cells in order  

---

## 📌 Conclusion  
The final model successfully segments customers into **five distinct groups**.  
These segments can be used by businesses for:  
- Targeted marketing  
- Personalized offers  
- Customer retention  
- Premium customer identification
